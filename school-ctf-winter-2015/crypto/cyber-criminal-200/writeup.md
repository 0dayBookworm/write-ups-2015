<div><h3>Cyber criminal</h3><p>Obviously the table is some sort of a key for the message.</p>
<p>We could try to google for ciphers that uses a table with cutouts and found out that it is Cardan grille cipher. Or just make an assumption that table is used to get some characters from the text written in such table.</p>
<p>So we just need to write text in 8 rows and try to get some phrase from cut out cells. The only meaningfull begining is "we_glad", so we found starting position for our grille.</p>
<p>Then just read letters from cut areas and rotate the grille CW untill you get the flag.</p></div>
