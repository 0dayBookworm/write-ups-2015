<div><h3>Lazy cryptanalyst</h3><p>Looking at the picture in task we could realize that it is simple substitution cipher.</p>
<p>Let's google for that nice site from picture. To do it google for phrase from the picture <code>To Crack a Substitution Cipher</code> and find the site looking like our example.</p>
<p>On a picture we have some letters cracked so we need to continue doing some assumptions about the plaint text, like "bsi" is a "the", "bsiri" - "these", "xb" - "it" and so on.</p>
<p>Trying to get meaningful words we can decrypt all the message. The phrase in the message that follows "flag is" is obviously our flag.</p></div>
