<div><h3>Pure color</h3><p>Reading the task description we could realize that it is all about colors. </p>
<p>If we look at the picture with an angle to the screen (do not work on cool retina screens :D) we could notice vary pale text <code>Flag is</code>. </p>
<p>So we need to try to change background color and then see the flag. The easiest way is just to use MS Paint.</p></div>
