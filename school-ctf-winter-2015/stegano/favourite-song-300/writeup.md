<div><h3>Favourite song</h3><p>Task tells us about some noises in the music. So the best way to check them is to see at sound histogram. </p>
<p>We can see some strange peaks on the histogram. Lets try to interpret it as Morse code (it's very common in defferent task with hidden information).</p>
<p>Decoding first peaks - long for dash and shorter for dots - we get <code>flag</code>. You just need to continue and get all the flag.</p></div>
