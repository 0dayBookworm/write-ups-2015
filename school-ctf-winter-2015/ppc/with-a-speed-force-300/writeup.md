<div><h3>With a Speed Force</h3><p>Obviously to get the secret we need to join the team, but when we try to join it says that we must save world more often. </p>
<p>We have 10 seconds to click the button enough times and register the user. It can be done with any mouse clicker tool or simple javascipt like that: </p>
<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; 101; i++) {
  $("i.circle").click()
