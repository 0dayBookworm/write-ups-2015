# Hack Dat Kiwi CTF 2015 2015: Leet Maze

**Category:** Forensics
**Points:** 250
**Solves:** 39
**Description:**

> We found a malware that communicates with track.dat.kiwi, however, there's nothing on track.dat.kiwi! It appears that they have established a complicated network of DNS records to point to the C&amp;C server.
> 
> 
> It's basically like CNAME, the software follows track.dat.kiwi to find out the target server. However, there are some caveats.
> 
> 
> <strong>Hint:</strong> To send a DNS request to a particular server for a particular record type, you can use the tool <strong>dig</strong> that comes with BIND like this:
> 
> 
> `dig @server track.dat.kiwi TXT`
