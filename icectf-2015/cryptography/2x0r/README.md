**Category:** Cryptography
**Points:** 80
**Description:** 

<p>So it turns out that repeated XOR isn't exactly secure. After realizing this, Idobe Corp decided to create a much more secure standard, which it calls 2x0r.</p><p>They provided a sample implementation <a target=_blank href="/api/autogen/serve/2x0r.py?static=true&pid=9c61fd4f2ab4623498fe0f3d3c0cc9c8">here</a>.</p><p>They also dared us to get the flag! Ofcourse, we take no such challenge lightly. Beat it out of them if you have to! <a target=_blank href="/api/autogen/serve/encrypted?static=false&pid=9c61fd4f2ab4623498fe0f3d3c0cc9c8">encrypted</a></p>
