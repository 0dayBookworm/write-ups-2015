# IceCTF 2015: Entropy

**Category:** Cryptography
**Points:** 110
**Description:** 

<p>We managed to get the flag, but it's encrypted! We found the keyserver that was used though, and stole its source. Could you figure out a way to decrypt the flag? You can get public keys from the keyserver with <code>nc vuln2015.icec.tf 30896</code>.</p><p><a target='_blank' href='/problem-static/stage3/crypto/entropy/server.py'>server.py</a> <a target='_blank' href='/problem-static/stage3/crypto/entropy/flag.txt'>flag.txt</a></p>
