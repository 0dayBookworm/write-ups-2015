# Cyber Security Challenge 2015: One Way

**Category:** Cryptography
**Points:** 100
**Description:**

> We want our employees to be able to send us confidential information which only we can decrypt. Since we donâ€™t believe in PKI (for religious reasons), we made our own crypto system. (Homemade is always better!). We prevent tampering, we took some precautions: A salt is added to each request and the IV is chosen at random for every connection. Take a look at [the given `clientFramework.py` file](clientFramework.py) for more info on how to use our crypto system.
