**Solves:** 
**Description:**

> My friend Mich uses this nice [tulip](https://github.com/EasyCTF/easyctf-2015-writeups/files/tulip.png) as her profile pic because she likes historical stuff. Did I mention that one of the EasyCTF developers worships her as a god?

> Hint: A tulip a day keeps the economy away :)
> 
> Hint: P.S. Everything you need is in the image...although you might need sharper vision.
