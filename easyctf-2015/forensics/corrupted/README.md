> I'm not an anime person, but I have weeaboo friends. One of them uses [this](<https://github.com/EasyCTF/easyctf-2015-writeups/files/yuno.jpg)> as her profile pic. Unfortunately, she sent me a corrupted version. Can you find out what she's hiding?

> Hint: Who is Yuno Gasai? From what I hear, she's a scary yandere.
> 
> Hint: On a more serious note, stop trying to fix the image. It's not broken -- it's hiding stuff.
