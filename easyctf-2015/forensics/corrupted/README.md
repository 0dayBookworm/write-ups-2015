# EasyCTF 2015: Corrupted (375)

**Category:** Forensics
**Points:** 375
**Solves:** 
**Description:**

> I'm not an anime person, but I have weeaboo friends. One of them uses [this](https://github.com/EasyCTF/easyctf-2015-writeups/blob/master/files/yuno.jpg) as her profile pic. Unfortunately, she sent me a corrupted version. Can you find out what she's hiding?
> 
> 
> Hint: Who is Yuno Gasai? From what I hear, she's a scary yandere.
> 
> Hint: On a more serious note, stop trying to fix the image. It's not broken -- it's hiding stuff.
