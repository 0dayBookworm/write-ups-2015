**Description:**

> You can try to sign messages and send them to the server, 52.0.217.48 port 60231. Sign the right message and you'll get the flag! Only problem---you don't have the signing key. I will give you this, though: sigs.txt is a file containing a bunch of signatures. I hope it helps. (P.S. Don't try and send the exact signatures in that file---that's cheating!) : 150
