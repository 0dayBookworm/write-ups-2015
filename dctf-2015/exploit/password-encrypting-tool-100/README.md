# Defcamp CTF Qualifications 2015 2015: password-encrypting-tool-100

**Category:** Exploit
**Points:**100
**Solves:**
**Description:**

>Our second newest programmer created a tool so that we can encrypt our usual passwords and use more secure ones wherever we register new accounts. He said that he left some sort of an easter egg that could leverage you, but he doesn't really expect anyone to get it. You are the newest programmer, can you find it and prove him you are the one?

> Hack the target when you've figured out with this [file](e100).
